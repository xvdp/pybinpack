changelist
: created parent class 'BinPack' to hold public 'usedRectangles'
: enum name array for reporting
: added index for reference
: merged node with rect


adapted from:
* @file ShelfNextFitBinPack.h
	@author Jukka Jylï¿½nki

	@brief Implements the naive Shelf Next Fit bin packer algorithm.

	This algorithm is not recommended for real use at all - its only advantage is that it
	consumes only a constant amount of memory, whereas the other packers in this library
	use at least a linear amount of memory.

	This work is released to Public Domain, do whatever you want with it.
